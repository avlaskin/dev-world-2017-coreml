How to set up Keras on Mac:
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
python pip 
pip install tensorflow # tensorflow-gpu as a option
pip install keras # coremltools now supports keras 2.x
pip install coremltools 
```

This repo has an example of Keras Neural network that does learn XOR function. Although training set is excessive (takes all possible cases) - it is a good starting point for understanding on how you can do Keras model for iOS.
