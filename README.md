How to set up Keras on Mac (assuming that you have Python installed):
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip install tensorflow# tensorflow-gpu as a option
pip install keras# coremltools now supports keras 2.x
pip install coremltools
```

This repo has an example of Keras Neural network that does learn XOR function. Although training set is excessive (takes all possible cases) - it is a good starting point for understanding on how you can do Keras model for iOS.
